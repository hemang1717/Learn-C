1. Take an integer age as an input from user. 	
If the age is less than 12 print "child"
If the age is between 13 and 19 print "teenage"
If the age is between 20 and 60 print "adult"
else print "old".

2. Take a character ch as an input from user.
If the ch is less than equal to g , print 1.
if the ch is greater than g and less than o. print 2
if the ch is greater than o and less than u. print 3
if the ch is greater than u and less than x. print 4
else print 5.

3. Take a character ch as input from user.
if the character is equal to a . print -> "ch is a"
if the character is equal to b . print -> "ch is b"
if the character is equal to c . print -> "ch is c"
else print "ch is neither a neither b nor c"
Implement this question with the help of switch case.
